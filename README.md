#Dataset Used
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/heart-statlog-cleveland-hungary-final
Downloaded the dataset from this website. This dataset is used because there are not many duplicates and it has only 11 features where the "ca" feature is 
excluded here, from which we can make a model without having unnecessary angiograms done and can predict the cardiovascular disease.

# Other Datasets
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data
Downloaded the dataset from this website. This dataset could also be used as there are no issues and can be used if you also want more accuracy in predicting
cardiac disease. But we didn't used this dataset because we wanted to tackle the unnecessary coronary angiograms as this dataset contains that "ca" feature.

Downloaded the dataset from this website. Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V (name- heart.csv) 
But heart.csv has 723 duplicates out of 1025 rows which is just too many. So we are not using that dataset here.

A4 Cardiac Disease.csv has so many duplicates, so we are not using that dataset.

There are other datasets in the project too but we are not using thos datasets simply because there are only 300-400 rows.
