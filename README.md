Downloaded the dataset from this website. Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V (name- heart.csv)

Based on the analysis, it is highly likely that "A4 Cardiac Disease.csv" with 1081 rows is derived from standard heart disease datasets (Cleveland, Hungarian, Swiss, Long Beach VA, Statlog), but as a processed or subset version, explaining the discrepancy from 1190 to 1081 rows, possibly due to row removal for completeness. The values are likely legitimate, aligning with medical data, not random. For precise identification, the user should check the dataset's documentation or source. Comparing with attachment id:1 (1199 rows, likely combined Cleveland, Hungarian, Statlog) may help, but exact composition requires the dataset. For further verification, consult UCI Heart Disease or Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset. But A4 Cardiac Disease.csv has so many duplicates, so we are not using that dataset.
